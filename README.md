# Hello-World
This is my learning space. Feel free to teach. I know nothing but I am eager to begin the journey of programming. 
I have always been curious about programming but I was never really exposed to codes and that kind of stuff.
Everything I know about computers I pretty much learned on my own.
I found some free courses online and I am now trying to learn Python.
I welcome advice on activities to engage in that will help me to get started.
As they say, practice makes perfect.
